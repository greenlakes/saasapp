Stripe Integration
* Users should have a stripe customer token in the users table.
* Javascript should prevent Pro form from submitting, when user fills it out,
and should send card info to Stripe. Stripe will return with a card token.
* Javascript should send user fields and card token (as a hidden field) to our rails app. 
Rails app should validate the user fields. Rails app will note whether plan 1 or plan 2.
* Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token
to Stripe server and Stripe will create a subscription and send back customer
token. Rails should save customer token and user information to our database.

(When our forms are submitted, we should record into our Users database table whether the customer is setting up a Basic account or Pro account.
We can do this by inserting the Plan ID inside both sign up forms using hidden fields.
Now, every user record (i.e. user object) will have a membership plan associated.)
